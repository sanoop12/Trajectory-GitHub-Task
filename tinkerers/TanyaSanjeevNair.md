Hello Everyone I am Tanya Sanjeev Nair
I am a Palakkad native and I am on my way to become an electronics and communication engineer. I am presently pursuing my degree in NSS College Of Engineering. I did my schooling From Kendriya Vidyalaya Palakkad. Entering the field of technology with a background of science is a roller coaster ride and I am down for some adventure. With some basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and Python I would like to learn and create more things.
