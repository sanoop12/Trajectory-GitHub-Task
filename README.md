# Git and Github Session - Task 2

Hey fellow tinkerers,
The two day session on Git and Github was indeed a blastâš¡.. we learned a lotta things which includes but not limited to, navigating the file system using the terminal, tracking changes in your codebase using git, creating a personal github account and using it collborate with remote developers. Now is the time to put your knowledge to the test!

Follow the instructions below to get your name featured on the websiteðŸ˜Œ

## Instructions

**Step 1:** Create a Github account if you haven't already, head to [Sign Up](https://github.com/signup)

**Step 2:** Fork this repo
Create a fork of this repo to your account.
``` 
ðŸ’¡ Click on the Fork button on the top right of the screen
```

**Step 3:** Install git on your PC if you haven't already, head to the [Git Downloads Page](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
``` 
ðŸ’¡ Installers and Instructions for all major OS is available on the same page
```

**Step 4:** Fire up your terminal/cmd and type `git --version`, if it displays something like below it means git has been succesfully installed in your system
```
$ git version 2.32.0.windows.1
```

**Step 5:** Setup git config variables, this is a one-time process. Run the following commands

`git config --global user.name "Your Name"` <br>
`git config --global user.email yourname@example.com`

**Step 6:** Navigate to your preferred location on your PC and clone the forked repo from your profile. Run the following command with your appropriate link

`git clone <your forked repo link>`

**Step 7:** Now that you have a local copy of the repository, try opening the folder using your preferred code editor

**Step 8:** Create a new file inside the `tinkerers` folder and name it <YOUR_NAME>.md. This is a markdown file, markdown is simillar to HTML but easier to use. You'll use this a lot to document your code as a developer. Here is a bit of markdown syntax to get you started

```markdown
Markdown is really easy and fun to use

For headers with varied sizes just vary the number of #
# Heading Largest
## Heading Larger
### Heading Large

- For bulleted
- Lists you could use this

1. And numbered
2. Lists just start with a number

For Bold, Italics and Code just wrap your text with the right characters
**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

For links and Images the text/alt-text goes inside the square brackets and link inside the the braces
[Link_Name](url) and ![Image_alt_text](src)
```
You can do a lot more with markdown, [click here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) to learn some more _markdown magic_ ðŸª„

**Step 9:** Now simply write down a few lines about yourself in the new file, tell us who you are in the most creative way possible
``` 
ðŸ’¡ PS: If you wanna take it a step further, try adding your image to your markdown file by adding it to the images folder and use the above mentioned syntax to display the image
```
```
For the image url use : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tinkerhub-NSSCE/git-and-github-session-task-2/main/images/<YOUR_FILE_NAME>
```

**Step 10:** Now get back to your terminal, make sure your inside the repository folder and commit and push the new changes to your own forked repository

`git add .` <br>
`git commit -m "commit by <YOUR_NAME>"` <br>
`git push -u origin main`

**Step 11:** Head to your github forked repository. You must see a message saying..
```
This branch is X commits ahead of Tinkerhub-NSSCE:main Compare and Pull request
```
Click on the `compare and pull request` button, add an appropriate title and decription and finally click `create pull request`
<br>
